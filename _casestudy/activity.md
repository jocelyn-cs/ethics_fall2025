## What's Going On?

Imagine you get to help design a video app for kids and teens like you. You don’t have to code anything, you just get to make choices about how the app works. There are no “right” answers. The goal is to think about how design choices can affect how people feel and act.

## Choice 1: Autoplay
When one video ends, what should happen next?

**Option A:** Videos autoplay endlessly

  Autoplay can make it harder to stop watching and easier to lose track of time.
</details>
<br>

**Option B:** The app pauses after a few videos

  Pausing gives kids a chance to decide whether they want to keep watching or do something else.
</details>

## Choice 2: What Videos You See
How should the app choose videos for you?

**Option A:** The app tracks everything you watch and shows similar videos

  Tracking can make videos more interesting but uses your data.
</details>
<br>

**Option B:** The app shows a mix of age-appropriate videos without tracking too much  

<details>

  Less tracking protects privacy but might feel less personalized.
</details>

## Choice 3: Time Reminders
Should the app tell you how long you’ve been watching?

**Option A:** No reminders

<details>
  <summary>What could happen? Click to see result.</summary>
  No reminders make it easy to lose track of time.
</details>
<br>

**Option B:** A message pops up after 30 minutes  

<details>
  <summary>What could happen? Click to see result.</summary>
  Reminders help you decide when to take a break.
