In this podcast we will be reflecting on the outputs created by 4 large languages models (ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, Claude) when being asked to fetch statistics on social media and it's impact on relationships. We observed hallucinations like the AIs citing incorrect sources and URLs. Some main takeaways include using AI less often and being more aware of it not being factual. Featuring Dylan-Dirac Nintunze and Marwa Idris.
