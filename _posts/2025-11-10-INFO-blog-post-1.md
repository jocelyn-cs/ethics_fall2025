Misinformation and Censorship

**News Article:**  
[Censorship of Misinformation and Freedom of Speech on Social Media](https://mit-serc.pubpub.org/pub/lkf63cu5/release/1)

## Purpose
  The MIT case study “Censorship of Misinformation and Freedom of Speech on Social Media” by Kevin Mills tackles the concept of censorship and misinformation on social media. Being on the opposing side, Mills argues that censorship makes social distrust worse and strips the public of open debate and discussion. He stresses that social media isn't necessarily the problem; it's the distrust we have in people and institutions, like news sources and the government. Mills dives into the origin of this distrust and brings attention to how and why a once-trusted information system turned into skeptical partisan media. All in all, the purpose of this case study is to show that censorship is not the solution for rebuilding trust. Rather, we should be focusing on practicing transparency and building a system that informs rather than silences. 

## Discussion (The use of creative work for training)
  1. **This case study discusses several examples in which misinformation appears to be worse now than it was in the past (e.g., vaccine skepticism and election conspiracies). Can you think of any other examples? How confident are you that this misinformation really is worse now?**
  - Another example I can think of when it comes to the worsening of misinformation would be topics surrounding climate change and global warming. I believe that a lot of people view it more as a political thing rather than an actual issue that affects everyone, regardless of their personal beliefs. Although it is hard to say that this misinformation has worsened now, since we can't really measure the statistics, I would say this idea of using real-world problems for political leverage rather than for a call to action has worsened over time. Not only this, but also the rise and spread of deeming information to be conspiracy theories, like the infamous epsoent files, for example.

  2. **If censorship were likely to be an effective tool in combatting misinformation on social media, would it be justified? Why or why not? And if so, in what cases and to what extent?**
  - In the interest of combating misinformation, I believe censorship would only be justified in extreme cases. In instances of graphic content or calls for violence, censorship would be justifiable. However, I know people who would say otherwise. I have friends on Instagram who often share very graphic images of the morbid reality of civilians at war with the intent to make you feel and do something about it. These videos and images often share information that we are forced to believe is reliable, due to the graphic nature of the post. However, I have also seen these posts be used for ill intent, not necessarily to inform, but rather to harm. Seeing very graphic images and videos being shared on social media without necessarily wanting to see that form of content could also do the opposite of what it's intended to do: Instead of informing, viewers may become distressed, pushing people to block out and try to avoid such content. In this sense of the matter, censorship would be justified. 
  
  3. **What things can you truly know by yourself, without relying on the trustworthiness of any other people and/or institutions?** 
  - In reflecting on this article, the things that you can truly know by yourself have to be simple enough to the point where you don't have to use outsourcing to understand them. The article mentions a massive dependence on people/institutions that feed information to us, like the role of the FDA and CDC. I, for one, would not be able to understand how the medicine that my doctor prescribed to me works or how effective the drug is; I just have to trust my doctor. As for politics, I normally just have my dad explain everything to me. Don't get me wrong, he's very educated in this field, but he gets most of his information from podcasts and YouTube videos that explain it to him. It's almost like a game of telephone: A lot of important information and context gets lost in the sauce.

  4. **What strategies can you employ to avoid falling for misinformation online?**
  - As mentioned briefly in class, one strategy you can employ to avoid falling for misinformation is to always be skeptical. Everything is misinformation until proven otherwise. I take my dad's information on politics with a grain of salt because I don't necessarily know the reliability of his sources. That being said, another strategy would be to listen to the experts, the REAL experts. I specify that because a lot of people may claim to be experts, like people calling themselves doctors to seem trustworthy, but really aren't. Additionally, perhaps confined to sources that aren't particularly opinion-based or heavily biased, but more so share reliable facts and information.

## New Discussion Question
  **Do you believe we will ever see an information system that is trusted completely? How can we create an information system supported by most?**
  
  I chose this question because of question #4 (What strategies can you employ to avoid falling for misinformation online?). It made me stop to think about if we'll ever see a time where we can simple trust the information that is presented to us. Many people don't have the time or ability to check their sources, for example. Which brings me to a greater question: How are different communities effected by misinformation and how does the impact differ?

## Reflection
  This case study made me stop to think about the types of misinformation and censorship I personally come across. Many of my friends like to know and see the raw details when it comes to current events. However, a lot of the times they spread misinformation in doing do. The importance of fact checking isn't talked about enough when it comes to social media, and I think it's because it's just easier to not. It's easier to hit a share button than it is to check the sources, for many. Censorship is very eye-opening concept when it comes to social media, because although many would like to know everything 100%, I think sometimes it does more good than harm.
