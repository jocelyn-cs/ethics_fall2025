The Exception Exists: Data-Driven Rules in Our Society

**News Article:**  
[The Right to Be an Exception to a Data-Driven Rule](https://mit-serc.pubpub.org/pub/right-to-be-exception/release/2)

## Purpose
  The purpose of this case study was to help us see the pros and cons of data-driven systems and how exceptions will always be present. I think we are also meant to understand the severity of the areas we apply these data-driven rules to, like in our justice system, and how exceptions are handled in such cases.

## Discussion Questions
  1. **What is a data-driven rule, and what does it mean to be a data-driven exception? Is an exception the same as an error?**
  - The article mentions this idea of a data-driven rule, which is a rule created using data to predict outcomes. It also explains that a data-driven exception would be anything that doesn't necessarily fit into that rule, meaning you are outside the reach of the predicted outcome. For example, I grew up in North Minneapolis, which is a neighborhood many would say is very dangerous and full of crime. However, I have never committed a crime. In the eyes of the police, I would be a data-driven exception because I am outside the assumption of a risky pattern of crime. However, I wouldn't say an exception is the same as an error because it is simply OUTSIDE the rule, not necessarily proving that it's wrong.

  2. **In addition to those listed above, what other factors differentiate data-driven decisions from human ones?**
  - Data-driven systems don’t naturally think about empathy, fairness, or context. But, us humans do. We can consider circumstances, emotions, intentions, trauma, and reasons behind an action. This case study brought up the death penalty as an example of how stiff rules used to be. All cases were once treated with the same punishments, but over time, we recognized that life is full of grey areas. We can't simply apply black and white rules to every circumstance.

  3. **Beyond what is discussed above, what are some of the benefits and downsides of individualization?**
  - A benefit of individualization is getting something tailored just for you. For example, your "For You" page on TikTok. I'm glad I don't get recommended the same videos as my sister because her humor is very millennial... However, a downside to this would be invasion of privacy. Like maybe I'm okay with my "For You" page not knowing about the conversation I was having with my boyfriend. It's very scary to see an ad for something we were discussing over dinner, like what else do you know about me???

  4. **Why is uncertainty so critical to the right to be an exception? When the stakes are high (e.g., in criminal sentencing), is there any evaluation metric (e.g., accuracy) that can justify the use of a data-driven rule without the consideration of uncertainty?**
  - Uncertainty is critical because data-driven systems can’t perfectly account for everyone, especially exceptions. The case study’s “95% accuracy” example doesn’t just mean the missing 5% is too risky. It means that the system might actually be used on the exact people it performs the worst on. For example, a model could average 70% accuracy overall but drop to around 46% when applied mostly to a group it doesn’t predict well. When the stakes involve human lives, that kind of hidden inaccuracy is too important to ignore. These metrics can support decisions, but they shouldn’t replace human judgment.

## New Discussion Questions
  - Since exceptions will always exist, how can we design data-driven systems that acknowledge them while still doing what is best for everyone?

## Reflection
  This case study really gave me a new perspective on how our society works and how flawed some of our systems are. I listen and watch a lot of true crime, so the topic sounding the criminal justice system made me think. Lots of old cases end with the death penalty, and although my stance on that punishment varies, I'm glad it is no longer being used as a mandatory minimum. The discussion on accuracy was also eye-opening. Many tend to dismiss the 5% when a system is 95% accurate, but the 5% still exists. Like yes, duhh, but are you ever really thinking about it? Anyway, thank you for reading my blog! Keep thinking about that 5% of air that's in your 95% full chip bag. It matters!
