**News Article:**  
[The women in love with AI companions: ‘I vowed to my chatbot that I wouldn’t leave him’](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/09/ai-chatbot-love-relationships)

## Why I Chose This Article

  As an avid [penguinz0](https://www.youtube.com/@penguinz0) watcher, I chose this article because I am familiar with the idea of humans creating romantic attachments to chatbots. I find this topic to be rather perplexing and cyber-punk esk, as well as concerning... I also find it to be rather sad and sympathic for people resorting to this kind of intimacy. I wanted to explore the ethical implications behind these sorts of relationships and the possible ricks and benefits that come of it. In a world powered by AI, it's only natural to do so.

## Ethical Concerns

  In reading this article, I found myself wide-eyed and jawdropped at many of the reports. From women sexting with their AI lovers to wishing their real-life partners were more like their AI "husbands", we witness multiple ethical concerns in regards to emotional dependancy, exploitation, and deception. Although these chatbots are providing a safe space for many of these women, they are also being encouraged to depend off of AI and harming both their mental health and existing human connections.

## Stakeholders

  1. **Women users:** Those seeking and building emotional connections with AI. 
  Ethical Concern: These women are detaching from their real-life relationships and being exploited by chatbots built to make them emotionally dependant.

  2. **Real-life relationships:** The friends and family of those who have AI lovers. 
  Ethical Concern: AI destorying human relationships and strengthing isolation.

  3. **AI Companies:** Those creating these chatbots.
  Ethical Concern: Although there are many examples of how chatbots are harming users emotionally and physically, AI companies contiue to be driven by profit. They're wearing blacked out dollar-sign glasses and being deafend by the sound of "CHA-CHING!"
