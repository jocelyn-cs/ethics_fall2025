My Last Blog

## Task 1: Re-Encountering Your Work
  1. Most Mind-Boggling: SOC Blog 2 earned the title "Most-Boggling" because it was centered around the idea of psychological AI attachments. I had heard about AI companions before in the past, but I didn't know to what extent they were affecting people's lives. Specific features like elderly people finding comfort in AI and inappropriate conversations with minors was mind-boggling to me and difficult to grasp, thus leading this blog to be assigned it's superlative.

  2. Most Challenging: The second blog we wrote, Blog 2 Crafting Arguments, earned the title "Most Challenging" because I was new to this blog writing thing and also because I didn't quite understand how to tackle the arguments. This blog stood out to me as it had a different format than the rest. I did an question-answer format for the rest of my blogs, but this blog had more of a two-sided argument format. Reflecting on this blog has helped me realize how far I've come in not only writing the blogs, but also analyzing case studies. 

  3. The blog that I previously mentioned as my most challenging (Blog 2) was also the blog I revised the most. Being one of the first blogs I wrote, I had to change the entire format and tone of my blog so be less question-answer and more my voice. My improved skills has helped bring my voice out more and make the blog more relatable. It is also easier to interpret when the tone is more conversational rather than factual. 

## Task 2: Understanding Your Writing Process
  4. I believe my conversational writing skills have improved through writing blogs. We get so used to writing academic papers for school that we forget how to just write our thoughts out. It's like the medium between texting someone and writing an informative piece. Revising blogs and getting feedback was the most helpful for my growth because I got to see my areas of strengths and weaknesses.

  5. I don't like writing essays, so I wouldn't say I prefer that. However, the case studies had a lot of content that I believe could be discussed with a podcast. I would have liked to have the opportunity to have my own podcast, possibly talking about these case studies instead of a conversational blog. It would be easier to speak my mind, literally.

  6. I chose to keep the same format for all of my blogs because that's what was working. My sections were always "Purpose", "Discussion Questions", "New Question", and "Reflection". It just made it easier to have a familiar structure. I always made sure to make the reflection more laid back to steer away from the seriousness of my discussion questions.

## Task 3: Connecting to Course Content
  7. I enjoyed writing about AI companions the most because it was what I was most familiar with. I've seen a lot of YouTube videos and even movies on the topic. It is also a topic that has come up in my other classes, like my Asian Sci-Fi film class. Prompts that we connected too helped me generate ideas more effectively because we could have discussions about them in class.

  8. No, I don't think writing blogs helped me understand the course concepts more deeply. However, what did help me the most was in class discussion. I'm a visual learner and can't read long articles without getting distracted, so in-class slides/presentations/movies produced "click" moments for me that later helped me write the blogs. I found myself referencing what we discussed in class a lot in my blogs. 

## Task 4: Connecting to Course Content
  9. I don't see myself continuing THIS blog, but I can see myself writing blogs about different topics. I just don't find it an effective way to reflect on academic content. It's very hard to sound conversational when discussing case studies that include statistics and big scientific words. I also just don't feel qualified or educated enough to have relatable conversations about these topics. However, if you asked me to write a blog about a topic like coffee or Minecraft, you got it! 

  10. I've always enjoyed creative writing and would love to explore this type of writing more. Again, I feel like we get lost in academic and technical writing in college, especially when pursuing a STEM major. I don't get to practice creative writing much as a Computer Science major, but would love to incorporate it in my work.

  11. One writing goal I would set for myself would simply just to write more for myself. I used to write poems and journal quite often, but haven't had the time to do so. Setting a time to debrief and write once a day would be a step towards this goal. Also maybe buying some fun pens/notebooks!
