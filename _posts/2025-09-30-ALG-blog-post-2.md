The Cost of Generative AI

**News Article:**  
[How Generative AI Works and How It Fails](https://mit-serc.pubpub.org/pub/f3o5mpn6/release/1#learning)

## Purpose
  The purpose of this case study is to teach us about how AI is developed/trained in order for us to reflect upon the ethics of such processes.

## Discussion (The use of creative work for training)
  1. **Is the practice of generative AI using the creative art of others ethical?**
  - I believe writers, artists, and other creators deserve recognition when their work is used to train AI. It feels unethical to claim or present AI-generated outputs without acknowledging their creators. At minimum, they should be credited, and if anything, they should have some control over how their work is used.

  2. **How can those who want to change the system go about doing so?**
  - Creating clear guidelines and push for new norms around responsible AI use is a step in that direction. For example, advocating for transparency, requiring companies to disclose training sources or even labeling AI-generated work.
  
  3. **Can the market solve the problem, such as through licensing agreements between publishers and AI companies?** 
  - Licensing agreements could be part of the solution, but I don’t think the market can solve this issue yet. AI is growing so quickly that it feels overwhelming to apply standards retroactively.

  4. **What about copyright law — either interpreting existing law or by updating it? What other policy interventions might be helpful?**
  - Copyright law could play a big role, but not right now. I think our current laws can't be applied because they weren’t written with AI in mind. However, updating copyright law to explicitly cover AI training data could help protect creators.

## New Discussion Question
  **How does AI generated work affect how we value creativity and art?**

  As someone who has always been an artsy-craftsy kind of gal, I chose this question because I believe the younger generation won't value creativity and art anymore. Like making creative short stories for English class- they can just ask AI to do that. Or even just art class will be so different. We are losing originality, and it's horific.

## Reflection
  This case study resonated with me more than I expected. When AI art first started appearing, I honestly thought it was kind of silly. The results were terrible, and I never really stopped to think about what it might turn into. But after learning about how quickly it’s growing, learning, and spreading into our society, it doesn’t feel so silly anymore. Sure, it’s cool to see what AI can do, but I don’t think we really have the ability to control it yet. I can’t even imagine what it will look like in 10 years. What a time for it to be my turn to be an adult...
