The Illusion of the "delete" Button

**News Article:**  
[Complete Delete: In Practice, Clicking 'Delete' Rarely Deletes. Should it?](https://mit-serc.pubpub.org/pub/fesqymtr/release/3?readingCollection=ca73f7c0)

## Purpose
  This case study explains what actually happens when clicking “delete”, pointing out how it rarely removes data completely. It highlights the privacy, security, and policy questions raised by remnant data in everyday technology.

## Discussion
  1. **Propose approaches for informing users of the existence of remnant data on their systems.**
  - The article points out how most people don’t realize deleted files still exist in different places. For example, when you delete a photo on an iPhone, it still sits in “recently deleted,” and may also stay in iCloud or even on your laptop if it synced earlier. I think users should be told this more directly, either when they press delete or when they create an iCloud account. There should also be an option to permanently delete something immediately instead of waiting 30 days or having to dig around in other folders. That would help people understand where their data actually lives.

  2. **Compare the advantages of deleting information with information permanence.**
  - The article mentions how people sometimes delete things they later wish they could get back (totally haven't done that before)... That’s one benefit of information permanence: You can recover something you didn’t mean to destroy. It also helps law enforcement, since deleted data can reveal evidence that someone thought was gone. But that same permanence can be a problem for privacy, especially when people intentionally delete something for personal reasons. So while permanence can be helpful, deletion gives people more control over their own information.
  
  4. **Rental Cars and Privacy** 
  - The question at hand describes how rental cars often keep the names and contacts of previous drivers’ phones. Most people don’t think about wiping the system after pairing their phones, and rental companies probably don’t take the time to do so either. I’d design a system where the car automatically clears all paired devices and data after each rental, instead of relying on a manual reset. To make sure the deleted data is truly gone and not just recoverable, the system should either overwrite the storage or use something like cryptographic erasure so the data can’t be pulled back.

  7. **Law Enforcement and Erasing Data**
  - I think law-abiding people and organizations should be able to permanently erase their data. There are plenty of reasons someone might want something gone for good, and that shouldn’t automatically be treated as suspicious. There are plenty of pictures and posts of my teenage years that should never see the light of day again. But this does affect law enforcement, since they depend on recovering deleted files in investigations. The only criminal investigation that involve my embarrassing pictures should be directed at my parents for giving me a phone at such a young age. I think people deserve the option to fully erase their own information, but I also see why that can be harmful. Yeah, the pictures I took where silly and goofy, but what if they weren't...

## New Discussion Question
  **In what you know now about what the delete button actually does, how will you go about using technology?**

  - I chose to include this question because this article really made me stop and rethink how I'll be using technology, like my phone and laptop, in the future. Maybe I'll stop taking pictures of what the back of my head looks like when I wear an updo.
  

## Reflection
  All jokes aside, this case study honestly scared me a little bit. God knows what infomation about me is out there that I believed to be deleted. On one hand, I'm glad law-enforcement can recover deleted evidence, especially in such a digitized society, but it also makes me more cautious about what I'm doing on my phone. I'm not saying I'm doing anything illegal, I just don't want anyone looking at my private information and images. I have Google Photos on my phone, and one day it just uploaded all of my phone images to my Google Account. It was really annoying because I didn't realize this until my Google email storage was full, and pictures that I had thought I deleted still existed in Google Photos. I also logged into a really old email and found that some of my photos from my childhood tablet were living in Google Photos. Yes, it was a bit wholesome, but also felt weird because I didn't know they were there the whole time. Makes me think about how many little kids are using iPads right now, not knowing where their silly pictures are going. I love the idea of having my precious memories being safe on a back-up, but hate how these systems are not transparent at all. If it wasn't for my storage being full, I would have never realized that all my photos were being uploaded to Google...
