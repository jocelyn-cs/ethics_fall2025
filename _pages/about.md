This page is meant for you to showcase your case study, podcasts, and blog posts reflecting on our readings. You will need to update the content in each section and submit your site to Moodle (see calendar). Once all sections are updated, revise this paragraph so it summarizes the purpose of your site for new visitors. This can include how to navigate it, what each section contains, and what someone should understand about your work just by reading this introduction.


About Me
---
My name is Jocelyn Chavez. I’m a Computer Science student in the Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science Department (https://wp.stolaf.edu/mscs/) at St. Olaf College. I'm earning my B.A in Computer Science.

Research 
---
Some topics I am currently interested in researching are Computational Storytelling and Game Design. I am a big supporter of indie games and small gaming start-ups!

In regards to ethics, I am interested in learning about AI-generated stories and narratives within gaming, as well as AI-generated art. 

Personal Life
---
I’m a Minneapolis native with a passion for both technology and creativity. As a computer science student, I’m especially interested in game design because it allows me to combine these two worlds. One day I’d love to work with an indie game studio, or maybe even start my own!
