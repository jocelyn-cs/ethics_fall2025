Welcome to my personal site! Here you’ll find a collection of my work as a Computer Science student. This site contains my case study, podcasts, and blog posts reflecting on class readings, giving you a sense of how I think about technology in relation ethics. You can explore the About Me section to learn a bit about my academic background, the Research section to see the topics I’m most curious about, and the Personal Life section for a more personal look at my interests and goals.

About Me
---
My name is Jocelyn Chavez. I’m a Computer Science student in the [Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science Department](https://wp.stolaf.edu/mscs/) at St. Olaf College. I also studied at the University of St. Thomas for a year, but ultimately transferred to St. Olaf to finish my studies. I'm earning my B.A in Computer Science.

Research

Some topics I am currently interested in researching are Computational Storytelling and Game Design. I am a big supporter of indie games and small gaming start-ups!

In regards to ethics, I am interested in learning about AI-generated stories and narratives within gaming, as well as AI-generated art. 

Personal Life

I’m a Minneapolis native with a passion for both technology and creativity. As a computer science student, I’m especially interested in game design because it allows me to combine these two worlds. One day I’d love to work with an indie game studio, or maybe even start my own!
