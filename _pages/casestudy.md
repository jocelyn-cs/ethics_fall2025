Drop spot for your case study work

## Overview

Here I will add a short description of my case study.

## Ethical Issues
1. **Could this decision or situation be damaging to someone or to some group, or unevenly beneficial to people? Does this decision involve a choice between a good and bad alternative, or perhaps between two “goods” or between two “bads”?**
    
    Yes. The situation can be damaging to children and teens who spend excessive time on YouTube or TikTok, as it may negatively affect their attention span, self-esteem, and mental health. At the same time, it is unevenly beneficial to tech companies that profit from youth engagement and data collection.

2. **Is this issue about more than solely what is legal or what is most efficient? If so, how?**
    
    Much of what these platforms do is legal and profitable, but the issue raises ethical questions about protecting children’s wellbeing, privacy, and development. It’s also about whether companies have a moral responsibility to design technology that prioritizes human health over profit, and whether society should hold them accountable for the long-term effects on the next generation.

## Facts
In this section I will add cited facts from articles I will be discussing. I will also add an infographic or something visually engaging.

## Evaluate Alternative Actions
Here I will analyze what we can do about this problem through a certain ethical lens (not sure which one yet).

## Reflection
Overall reflection and application of my decision.
